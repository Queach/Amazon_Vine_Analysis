## Summary

There is not nearly enough evidence to provide any feedback. There were no vine reviews in this dataset so the analysis is cut and dry that it has no current effect for any positivity bias.
For this analysis to work further data would have to be collected to confirm whether there could be a bias or not. But if there was more data an analysis that could be used is to find the percentage  
of the total number of 5 star reviews to the total number of paid 5 star reviews and compare population sizes.
